# ‚ùì Questions for Better Understanding
### Agile Development
1. Write an example of a user story for the customer(renter) of a car in a car rental company.
2. What is the purpose and reason of using acceptance criteria?

### Git Branching
1. How does Git store its data, and what does a commit object contain?
2. What is the purpose of the HEAD pointer in Git's branching system?
3. What commands are needed to produce and switch to a new branch?
4. What commands are needed to merge your current branch to the main branch?

### MVC Architecture
1. How does a Template vary from the definition of a View? What is Django's 'opinion' on this?
2. Which layer holds the business logic?
3. Describe the control flow for if a user accesses a form, fills a form, and then submits a form. Describe using MVC architecture.
4. Describe the control flow for if a user accesses a form, fills a form, and then submits a form. Describe using MVT architecture.
5. How is a View different in MVC vs MVT architecture?

### Web Architecture / Django
1. What is the difference between a django app and a django project?

# Homework
* Generate a User Story for some aspect of the MVP.
* Using this User Story, generate a well-documented ticket with a clear "Definition of 'Done'"
